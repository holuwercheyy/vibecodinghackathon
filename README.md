🎧 Vibe Coding Hackathon — For the #1MillionDevs Movement!
Hey PLP Community!
We’re absolutely thrilled to welcome you to the Vibe Coding Hackathon, where rhythm meets real-world impact! 🚀
 This is your moment to code with joy, creativity, and purpose using the latest AI-assisted and low-code tools to bring powerful ideas to life! Whether solo or as a team, the mission is simple: build human-centered, joy-driven tech solutions that solve real community challenges. 🌍💡

Hackathon Theme
“Building Human-Centered, Joy-Driven Solutions Using AI and Low-Code Tools.”
 Let’s explore how smart tools and creative coding can reshape the way we solve everyday problems!

Problem Statements & Challenges
🛒 Retail & Ecommerce: Lightweight Storefront Builder
Problem: Many small traders don’t track their income or expenses and have no idea if they’re making a profit.
Challenge: Build a mobile/web app that uses voice or photo input to help business owners track income and expenses in real-time.




🌾 Agritech: Market Match Platform
Problem: Small-scale farmers lack information about where and when to sell their produce.
Challenge: Create a platform that alerts farmers about local market prices and connects them to nearby buyers or markets.

🧮 Retail Shopkeepers: Price Tracker Tool
Problem: Shopkeepers in informal markets struggle with rapidly changing supplier prices.
Challenge: Build a tool that helps them compare and track supplier prices to make smarter purchases.

🏥 Healthtech: Follow-Up Reminder System
Problem: Clinics and private doctors often lose track of patient follow-ups.
 Challenge: Develop a tool that automatically reminds both doctors and patients of appointments via SMS, WhatsApp, or other channels.

💈 Local Salons, Barbershops & Eateries: Loyalty Rewards App
Problem: Local businesses lack systems to retain loyal customers.
Challenge: Create a loyalty system that uses phone numbers to track visits and reward frequent customers.
